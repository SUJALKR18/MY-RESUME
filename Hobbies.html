<h1><u>HOBBIES</u></h1>

<p>Beyond academics, I have a keen interest in drawing and coding. Drawing allows me to express my creativity and find balance, while coding fuels my desire to create innovative solutions. These hobbies not only provide me with a sense of fulfillment but also enhance my problem-solving skills and attention to detail. As I continue my studies and look forward to new opportunities, I am excited to leverage my skills and passion to contribute to impactful projects and be a part of a dynamic and forward-thinking team.</p>
